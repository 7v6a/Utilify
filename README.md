Due to a huge inactivity of KoGaMa's Community, I no longer see it worth to work on this extension.
I also know of no active users of my extension, meaning I get no additional requests nor bug reports.

Thank you to everybody who supported and used it. I will move on to bigger and more advanced projects from now on. :)

The function to check for updates will be deleted in that final version to prevent overloading any sort of ToS.

I love you! - Simon.
