<h2>About Utilify</h2>
<p>
Utilify is an tampermonkey addon meant to port as much <b>KoGaBuddy</b> features as possible into a globally accesible format in tampermonkey.<br>
Not only I do my best to recreate functionality of KoGaMaBuddy but also add my own tweaks and adjustements for your complete comfort.<br><br>

</p>

> [!CAUTION]
> <h2>Read Before Using</h2>
> <p>
>  Around 1st October I as well as my friends have gotten banned for a lot of reasons regarding <i>cheating</i> even if Utilify was the only thing used.<br>
>  Take it as a warning that despite what this script offers it can bring damage to your account.<br>
>   Please consider it carefully before even trying to install Utilify.<br><br>
> After contacting a couple people that have better connections with administration Utilify,<br> apparently contains nothing that should trigger anti-cheat however it still got us banned.<br><br>
> Please take it as a <b> SOLID WARNING </b> regarding your account. I want to create things that ease your experience, not demolish it.
