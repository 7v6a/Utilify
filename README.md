<h2>About Utilify</h2>
<p>
Utilify is an tampermonkey addon meant to port as much <b>KoGaBuddy</b> features as possible into a globally accesible format in tampermonkey.<br>
Not only I do my best to recreate functionality of KoGaMaBuddy but also add my own tweaks and adjustements for your complete comfort.<br><br>

Please remember to stay safe and absolutely never try scripts that you don't understand or don't know origin of.<br>
The only <b>safe place</b> to acatually get Utilify from is either <a href="https://github.com/unreallain/Utilify/">this github respository</a> or <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/505596-utilify-kogama">GreasyFork</a>.<br>
Never trust optional sources if you value your privacy.

<h2>Read Before Using</h2>
<p>
 Around 1st October I as well as my friends have gotten banned for a lot of reasons regarding <i>cheating</i> even if Utilify was the only thing used.<br>
 Take it as a warning that despite what this script offers it can bring damage to your account.<br>
  Please consider it carefully before even trying to install Utilify.<br><br>
 After contacting a couple people that have better connections with administration Utilify,<br> apparently contains nothing that should trigger anti-cheat however it still got us banned.<br><br>
 Please take it as a <b> SOLID WARNING </b> regarding your account. I want to create things that ease your experience, not demolish it.
